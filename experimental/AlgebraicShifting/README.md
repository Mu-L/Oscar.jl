# An example template for the experimental section

## Aims

This package grew out of a project of Antony della Vecchia, Michael Joswig and Fabian Lenzen on "Partial Algebraic Shifting".
Part of this project is the development of new methods for algebraic shifting; these are implemented here.

## Status

Full and partial shifting in the exterior algebra fully functional.
